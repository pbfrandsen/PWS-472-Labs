## Lab 3: DNA Barcoding

Using the Barcode of Life Data System to identify unknown samples of DNA

In this lab, you will be identifying unknown sequences in a file using the Barcode of Life Data System ([BOLD](boldsystems.org)).

You will be instructed in class how to access and use BOLD. If you are not in class, please meet up with a fellow student or come to student hours for more instruction.

Your data file is on the content tab of Learning Suite under Lab Tutorials > Lab 3 Data. Select the text file corresponding to your last name and download another file called Lab3_unknown_sequences_list.txt.

You will see several numbers in your own file. Use those numbers to find the corresponding sequences from the Lab3_unknown_sequences_list.txt . Your job is to use the BOLD identification engine to identify each of these unknowns. For the purposes of the assignment assume that these unknowns all came from samples that collected from different national parks in Alberta, Canada.

In your lab report, you should report about each of the unknown species in a table. This table should include the probability of placement, the gene used, the geographical location of the most closely related individuals in the database, and the species name that matched. 

In addition to identifying the details above for each of the unknowns, for one of them, let's go more in depth. When you identify the species, there is a small icon under “Tree.” Click on that icon. You should receive a pop-up and then be able to view the tree. What do you notice about the distance to other species? Include this figure in your lab report along with some discussion on what you notice.

A few things to think about in preparing your lab report:
1.	What are DNA barcodes and why are you using them here?
2.	Are the species that you identified from the same place? If not, what are some possible explanations for this (don't freak out if they aren't from the same place, but have some fun with why this might be)?
3.	In this water sample, how well do the barcodes work for identifying these species?
