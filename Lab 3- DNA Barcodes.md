## Lab 3: DNA Barcoding

Using the Barcode of Life Data System to identify unknown samples of DNA

In this lab, you will be identifying unknown sequences in a file using the Barcode of Life Data System ([BOLD](boldsystems.org)).

You will be instructed in class how to access and use BOLD. If you are not in class, please meet up with a fellow student or come to student hours for more instruction.

Your data file is on the content tab of Learning Suite under Lab Tutorials > Lab 3 Data. Select the text file corresponding to your last name and download it.

You will see several sequences your own file. Your job is to use the BOLD identification engine to identify each of these unknowns. For the purposes of the assignment, assume that these unknowns all came from samples from a specific biome somewhere in North America. Part of your objective is to try to figure out which biome they were derived from and approximately where in North America they could have come from. Be careful because there could be invasive species or contaminant sequences in your list.

In your lab report, you should report about each of the unknown species in a table. This table should include the probability of placement, the geographical location of the most closely related individuals in the database, and the species name that matched. 

In addition to identifying the details above for each of the unknowns, for one of them, let's go more in depth. When you identify the species, there is a small icon under “Tree.” Click on that icon. You should receive a pop-up and then be able to view the tree. What do you notice about the distance to other species? Include this figure in your lab report along with some discussion on what you notice.

A few things to think about in preparing your lab report:
1.	What are DNA barcodes and why are you using them here?
2.	Are the species that you identified from the same place? If not, what are some possible explanations for this (don't freak out if they aren't from the same place, but have some fun with why this might be)?
3.	Which biome do you think your samples came from (e.g., forest, marine, freshwater, alpine, desert)
4.	Did you notice anything about the health of the ecosystem? Were there invasive species? Could metabarcoding be a good way to detect the spread of invasive species.
5.	In these samples, how well do the barcodes work for identifying these species?
