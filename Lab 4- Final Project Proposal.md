## Lab 4: Final Project Proposal

This is the final project proposal. As we covered in class, your final project proposal is your lab assignment for the week. In your final project proposal, I'd like you to cover the following information:

- the organism that you propose to study
- the question that you are trying to answer
- the type of genetic data that you propose to use and where you have found it online, including exact details about the molecular markers you are using/NCBI accession numbers/BOLD IDs
- the genetic analyses that you are planning, including each step that you will take to analyze the data, the names of the software you plan to use, the commands that will allow you to perform the project, etc.
- how you plan to relate your project to conservation

Please write this in paragraph form and include an Introduction and Materials and Methods describing the analyses that you are proposing. You can think of this as more similar to a grant proposal than a scientific manuscript (without requesting a budget, of course).
