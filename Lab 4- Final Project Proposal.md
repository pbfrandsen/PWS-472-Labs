## Lab 4: Final Project Proposal

This is the final project proposal. As we covered in class, your final project proposal is your lab assignment for the week. In your final project proposal, I'd like you to cover the following information:

- the organism that you propose to study
- the type of genetic data that you propose to use and where you have found it online
- the genetic analyses that you are planning
- how you plan to relate your project to conservation
